# The past projects of Henry Gann

I have included below a summary of the various languages that I have used and an overview of the projects these langauges have been used to complete

**C**

I have used C to perform multiprocessing tasks. The featured files use a merge sort and insertion sort hybrid. I have applied various methods of multiprocessing to speed up this sorting process. I have used 8 threads, where each thread has been assigned a part of the datablock to sort.
I have also used the Unix 'Fork' function to generate 8 processes. In one method, I am sorting different parts of the data block and using pipes to send the sorted data back to the parent process. In another, I have allocated the data block as shared memory between the processes.

*Please note that I used 8 processes and threads because my CPU had 8 logical processors.*

**C++** 

Using Object-Oriented Programming, I implemented linked-lists to help simulate lanes of traffic. This involved using inheritance.

**R**

I have used R to perform basic data wrangling as well as data analysis. This was done largely through the 'Tidyverse' library which allows data to be sorted and presented tidily. This analysis involve two-sample t-testing and ANOVA analysis.

**Python**

Python has been my most frequently used language. I have used python for a large number of purposes. These include implementing Dijkstra's greedy shortest path algorithm, data wrangling using Pandas and implementing a file system in Main Memory using FUSE (Not shown in the repository). 

**Websites**

I have included 2 websites. The first was for an assignment. We needed to generate a website for a group called 'Book Program Discussion' and provide a registration form that can be opened with the 'Register Now' button. This had to work with the widths 1920-900px. The registration form looks weird at large widths due to time constraints on the project. It also required the use of the dark-green colour that is prominent throughout much of the page. This website incorporates HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The other item is a webapp for the Auckland University Muay Thai club (Martial Art). I am the 2021 Web developer in charge of maintaining and updating the website. The website uses React as well as CSS and has a Firebase server that contains data for all the members. I am not the sole contributor to this project, but I have added pages and performed maintenance on the webapp.
