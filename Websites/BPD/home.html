                    Book Program Discussion was initially brought about by people very similar to you! The founders were avid readers that wanted to meet other people with the same hobby as them. With their combined skills and effort, they eventually managed to compile a large number of books they could lend out to people like you. Thanks to our founders, BPD was born! Read more below.
